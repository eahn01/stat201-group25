    "A country's developed/developing status is mainly based on their GDP and living standards. To look at an example of how a countries status may effect itâ€™s life expectancy: Ethiopa (a developing country) and the United States (a developed country). By comparing the living standards between Ethiopia and the US, Freeman (2020) finds out that the latter has longer life expectancy due to various factors like community-based health strategies, improving access to safe water, female education and gender empowerment, and so on. However, there is another view which deems that with the improvement of modern technology, the impact from factors like mortality has been overstated for earlier periods (Preston, 1975). This raises the question, is there a difference in life expectancy between developed and developing countries, if so is it significant? The random variable is life expectancy, the location parameter is mean, and the scale parameter is standard deviation. Our population is all countries, our dataset contains data, provided by the WHO, contains annual data observations from 2000-2015 of 193 countries. Each observation contains information on the country and year as well as socioeconomic (government spending, GDP, schooling, alcohol use) and health (BMI, immunizations, diseases) factors\n"
